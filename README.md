# nasa-wallpaper-changer
This little tool changes your Linux wallpaper daily to NASA's Astronomy Image Of The Day.
It does that by installing a cronjob that runs this script every hour. 
It works without NASA's APOD API, so no API-key is required.
The tool is built for Linux GNOME environments and was successfully tested on Debian.

# Installing
Execute the following commands:
    
    git clone https://github.com/D3PSI/nasa-wallpaper-changer.git
    cd nasa-wallpaper-changer/
    sudo ./install.sh
    
And then run the tool like so (not as superuser!):

    python3 /usr/local/bin/nasa-wallpaper-changer/nasa-wallpaper-changer.py
    
And you are ready to go. The tool will run every hour, at reboots and every day at 0:00 to check, if NASA has released a new Astronomy Image Of The Day. For that purpose, it will install a crontab.

# Uninstalling

To uninstall the tool execute the following:
 
    sudo rm -r /usr/local/bin/nasa-wallpaper-changer

After this, uninstall the automatically installed crontabs by typing:

    sudo crontab -e
    
and removing the following line:

    @reboot python3 /usr/local/bin/nasa-wallpaper-changer/nasa-wallpaper-changer.py
